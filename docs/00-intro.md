## Project Goals

WebserviceKit aims to be a fast, highly resilient transport layer for talking
to RESTful style APIs especially suited for Service Oriented Architectures.

- **Fast**: Speed is everything with HTTP APIs, so WebserviceKit should get out of the way
- **Resilient**: No data, no website. Do everything you can to return
- **Flexible**: Any backend, any response format. All the control in your hands.
- **Good Citizen**: Respect caching headers. Consume responsibly.
- **Testable**: Provide a simple and powerful way of testing Service backends.
- **High Quality**: fully unit tested, code sniffed and documented.
